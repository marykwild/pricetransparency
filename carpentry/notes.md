This repository contains the carpentry process for the machine readable price transparency files in Connecticut. 
Almost exclusively, I used the R programming language and its related libraries to clean these files. In one case, BeautifulSoup was needed; see the Jupyter notebook.
Note many of the files contain separate code, usually at the bottom, for extracting the minimum and maximum rates from these files as well as the cash (also known as self-pay) rates.
