Making Connecticut hospitals' files readable and comparable.

For this project, all data was checked for updates during late March and early April. Here is where we sourced that data:

Hospitals were required to disclose various prices as a part of the federal rule. For this analysis, we focused on prices attached <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Fraud-and-Abuse/PhysicianSelfReferral">to CPT and HCPCS codes,</a> because this data had the greatest amount of overlap between hospitals and health systems in Connecticut, making some comparisons possible.
